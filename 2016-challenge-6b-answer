JAMELIA, WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THIS? DO YOU THINK DYNAMIX WOULD FUND IT?
PROPOSAL: LONG BASE LINE SIGNAL NOISE ANALYSIS IN LARGE SCALE HETEROGENEOUS NETWORKS
M. TRAYNOR AND J. DALMAR
ABSTRACT
IN OUR WORK ON SIGNAL NOISE ANALYSIS FOR LIGO WE HAVE DEVELOPED NEW TOOLS FOR DIGITAL ANALYSIS OF EXTREMELY LOW AMPLITUDE SIGNALS IN AN EXCESSIVELY NOISY ENVIRONMENT. THE CLASSICAL FEATURES OF THIS ANALYSIS ARE THE EXPLOITATION OF VERY LONG BASELINE SIGNAL COLLECTION, AND THE SYNTHESIS OF SIGNALS FROM A LARGE SENSOR NETWORK TO FILTER THE NOISE. THE PRINCIPLE NOVEL FEATURE IS THE DEVELOPMENT OF A LARGE DATABASE OF TEMPLATES OF TARGET SIGNALS THAT ALLOW THEM TO BE FILTERED FROM THE NOISE AND INTERPRETED IN REAL TIME. WE BELIEVE THIS APPROACH CAN BE ADAPTED TO A WIDE VARIETY OF SIGNAL HARVESTING PROBLEMS BOTH WITHIN AND OUTSIDE THE PHYSICAL SCIENCES. AS AN EXAMPLE OF A COMMERCIAL APPLICATION OF THE TECHNOLOGY WE HAVE CARRIED OUT ANALYSIS OF A TOY MODEL WHICH SUGGESTS THAT THIS APPROACH MAY BE SENSITIVE ENOUGH TO TRACK INDIVIDUAL FOOTFALL ACROSS A SHOPPING CENTRE OR AIRPORT CONCOURSE AND TO CARRY OUT GAIT ANALYSIS USING SEISMOMETERS EMBEDDED IN THE BUILDING FABRIC. THIS WOULD PROVIDE A NEW AND LESS OBTRUSIVE ALTERNATIVE TO THE CAMERA SYSTEMS CURRENTLY IN USE. 
IT HAS NOT ESCAPED OUR ATTENTION THAT THE TEMPLATE BANK APPROACH SHOULD SCALE TO ALLOW TRACKING OF MULTIPLE TARGETS AND TO SEARCH FOR PATTERNS THAT MAY SIGNAL ANTISOCIAL, OR POTENTIALLY EVEN TERRORIST BEHAVIOUR PATTERNS. MORE SPECULATIVELY, THE LONG BASE LINE TECHNIQUES, WHICH ARE KEY TO TRIANGULATING THE SOURCE OF GRAVITATIONAL WAVES, COULD BE MODIFIED TO PROVIDE A TEMPLATE BASED NETWORK ANALYSIS TOOL FOR FINDING LONG RANGE CORRELATIONS IN NETWORK TRAFFIC. THIS ANALYSIS COULD SIGNAL ACTIVITY SPIKES AMONG TRANS-NATIONAL CRIMINAL OR TERRORIST GROUPS TRIGGERING SURVEILLANCE AND TARGETING EARLY INTERVENTION TO PREVENT CRIME.
