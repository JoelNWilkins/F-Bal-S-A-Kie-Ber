I CAN'T BELIEVE HE LEFT LIKE THAT. AFTER EVERYTHING WE SAID, AFTER EVERYTHING WE AGREED. BUT HE HAS GONE, AND I CAN'T FIND HIM, AND THIS IS TOO BIG TO DEAL WITH ALONE. I CAN'T BLAME HIM MORE THAN ME, WE WERE BOTH BLIND TO WHAT WAS HAPPENING AND WE ARE BOTH GUILTY, BUT TOGETHER WE MIGHT HAVE STARTED TO FIX IT. I CAN'T SEE HOW I CAN DO THAT ALONE, HERE, NOW. SO I DON'T HAVE AN OPTION. IT HAS TO END. I HAVE TO END IT.
