HARRY AND CHARLIE, 
I AM NO CLOSER TO THE PDS SYNDICATE BUT I THINK I HAVE BEGUN TO UNRAVEL WHY THEY MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN JAMELIA AND MARTIN.
AS SHE TOLD US IN THE HIDDEN MESSAGE I SENT LAST WEEK, JAMELIA HAD BEEN WORKING ON SIGNAL RECOGNITION AT DYNAMIX. AT FIRST I WAS PUZZLED BY THIS AS I COULDN’T SEE HOW IT RELATED TO WEAPONISED GRAVITY WAVES, BUT THEN I TOOK A LOOK AT HER BOOKSHELF AND IT BEGAN TO MAKE SENSE. IT WAS FULL OF BOOKS ON GENERAL RELATIVITY, BLACK HOLES, AND NEUTRON STARS. JAMELIA WAS NOT WORKING ON GRAVITY WAVES, BUT ON GRAVITATIONAL WAVES. I CAN SEE HOW THE FIELD AGENTS WOULD HAVE GOT CONFUSED. IN THE US THEY SOMETIMES USE BOTH NAMES FOR THE SAME THING – BUT THEY REALLY ARE DIFFERENT. GRAVITY WAVES ARE A SEISMOLOGICAL PHENOMENON AS YOU ALREADY FIGURED OUT. GRAVITATIONAL WAVES ARE ENTIRELY DIFFERENT. EINSTEIN PREDICTED THEM A HUNDRED YEARS AGO AND THEY WERE DETECTED BY THE LIGO TEAM LAST YEAR. THE SIGNALS ARE GIVEN OFF BY THINGS LIKE BINARY BLACK HOLE SYSTEMS AND ARE INCREDIBLY FAINT. THEY EASILY GET SWAMPED BY LOCAL NOISE. IT WAS AN AMAZING FEAT DETECTING THEM AND JAMELIA WAS PART OF THAT. TO ADD TO OUR CONFUSION, SHE WAS IN THE TEAM RESPONSIBLE FOR DESIGNING THE SEARCH ALGORITHMS AND THE NOISE FILTERS USED TO SPOT THE SIGNAL OF A GALACTIC EVENT AGAINST THE NOISE OF SEISMOLOGICAL ACTIVITY, SO SHE DID KNOW SOMETHING ABOUT GRAVITY WAVES TOO.
I STILL DON’T KNOW EXACTLY HOW DYNAMIX WERE USING HER EXPERTISE, OR WHAT THE PDS SYNDICATE ARE OR DO, IF YOU CAN GET ANY INTEL ON THAT IT MIGHT HELP GUIDE MY ENQUIRIES. THE NOISES I AM HEARING SUGGEST THAT PDS ARE SERIOUS. LOTS OF CASH, LOTS OF INFLUENCE, SO I SUGGEST WE INCREASE THE SECURITY FOR FUTURE MESSAGES. WHEN YOU REPLY TRY USING A DOUBLE ENCRYPTION, REVERSING THINGS BEFORE APPLYING A KEYWORD CIPHER TO THE MESSAGE.
I WILL BE OUT OF CONTACT FOR THE REST OF THE WEEK. I AM TAKING A CRASH COURSE IN NEUTRON STAR DYNAMICS IN THE HOPE THAT I CAN FIT IN BETTER WITH THE LOCALS. I HAVE A TEST AT DYNAMIX ON THURSDAY FOR AN INTERNSHIP IN THEIR PROGRAMMING SECTION. IF I CAN GET ACCESS TO THEIR NETWORK, THEN MAYBE WE CAN START TO UNRAVEL THIS.
IN THE MEANTIME I FOUND THE ATTACHED MEMO SLIP FOLDED UP UNDER ONE LEG OF JAMELIA’S DESK. AT FIRST I THOUGHT IT WAS JUST A FIX FOR A WOBBLY DESK BUT IT TURNED OUT TO BE A FANTASTIC PLACE TO HIDE A SECRET! IT REMINDED ME OF THE PURLOINED LETTER, WHICH, GIVEN THE KEYWORD IS PROBABLY NO COINCIDENCE. IT LOOKS LIKE JAMELIA AND MARTIN SHARED A LOVE OF OLD DETECTIVE STORIES.
TRINITY.
