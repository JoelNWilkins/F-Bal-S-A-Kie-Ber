HARRY AND CHARLIE, 
NOT MUCH TIME, AND I NEED TO SPEND THE TIME I HAVE CAREFULLY. I HAVE ACCESS TO THE DYNAMIX NETWORK AND USED IT TO HACK INTO CITADELLE. THEY HAVE A LARGE DATABASE THAT A NUMBER OF PEOPLE HERE ARE WORKING ON. MOSTLY MAINTENANCE AND DATA ENTRY, BUT JAMELIA’S TEAM SEEM TO HAVE BEEN WORKING ON MINING THE DATA. NOTHING TOO SURPRISING REALLY AND AT FIRST I COULDN’T SEE WHAT THE FUSS WAS ABOUT, BUT AGAIN I GOT LUCKY. JAMELIA’S ACCOUNT ON THE MACHINE THEY GAVE ME HAD BEEN WIPED BUT THEY MISSED A CONFIG FILE THAT SHOWED ME THAT SHE HAD USED AN ONLINE STORAGE SERVICE FOR SOME OF HER FILES, AND ONE OF THEM WAS HUGE. THE CLIENT SOFTWARE KEPT METADATA ABOUT THE FILE AND IT LOOKS LIKE A CLONE OF THE DATABASE I HAVE SEEN HERE, BUT THE FILE SIZE IS WAY OFF AND THE STORAGE SCHEME SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN FORMATTED WITH POINTERS TO HIDDEN PARTS OF THE FILE THAT DWARF THE DATABASE I HAVE SEEN IN THE CITADELLE SERVERS. I DON’T KNOW ABOUT THE DATABASE ITSELF BUT I ALSO FOUND WHAT LOOKS LIKE AN ENCRYPTED DB SCHEME FILE. IF YOU CAN SEND ME JAMELIA’S OLD LAPTOP OR PHONE I THINK THERE IS A CHANCE WE COULD RECOVER SOME OF THE DOCUMENTS THAT SHE HAD DELETED BY SYNCING IT TO THE SERVER. IF HER KEYCHAIN HAS BEEN COPIED OVER THAT MIGHT ALSO GIVE ME ACCESS TO THE CITADELLE DATABASE, WHICH I HAVE CODENAMED TITAN. 
I THINK WE MIGHT BE GETTING CLOSE TO THE TRUTH, BUT I AM ALSO SURE THAT I AM NOT TRUSTED HERE AND THAT WILL MAKE IT HARD TO GET MUCH MORE INTELLIGENCE WITHOUT RAISING ALARM. OTHERS SEEM TO HAVE FAIRLY FREE ACCESS TO THE BUILDING BUT MY PASS ONLY GETS ME TO ONE FLOOR AND THREE ROOMS. EVERYONE IS FRIENDLY, BUT NO-ONE IS TALKING AND I DON’T WANT TO PUSH TOO HARD AND MAKE THEM MORE SUSPICIOUS. I WOULD SUGGEST WE SWITCH BACK TO SUBSTITUTION CIPHERS IN THE FUTURE. THIS IS GETTING SERIOUS. MAYBE A VIGENERE OR HILL CIPHER NEXT TIME?
