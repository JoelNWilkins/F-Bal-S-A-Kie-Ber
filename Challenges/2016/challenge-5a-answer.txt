HARRY, 
IT IS HARD TO MAKE SENSE OF THE LATEST MESSAGE FROM MARTIN. WHAT IS THE TEMP BANK? IS IT A NETWORK OF PART TIME SPIES? JAMELIA IMPLIED THAT IT WAS HER CODING SKILLS THAT DYNAMIX WERE INTERESTED IN SO I BEGAN TO WONDER IF JAMELIA WAS WORKING ON A RECRUITMENT TOOL USING SOCIAL MEDIA, BUT THAT SOUNDS A BIT OLD SCHOOL. COULD SHE AND MARTIN HAVE BEEN DEVELOPING A SCREENING ALGORITHM FOR AGENTS, TRYING TO PICK OUT THE MOST RELIABLE ONES BY DATA MINING? HOW WOULD THAT HAVE FITTED WITH HER REAL EXPERTISE IN SIGNAL NOISE ANALYSIS? SURELY THE DATA ISN'T THAT NOISY? 
I DID HAVE SOME LUCK WITH BACKGROUND ON THE PDS SYNDICATE. THEY WERE INITIALLY SET UP TO DEAL WITH A FUTURE IN WHICH QUANTUM TRANSMISSION MAKES IT IMPOSSIBLE TO CRACK CIPHERS USING DIGITAL METHODS. PDS STANDS FOR POST DIGITAL SURVEILLANCE AND THEY WERE AN ARM’S LENGTH CABINET OFFICE INITIATIVE KEPT COMPLETELY SEPARATE FROM THE OTHER INTELLIGENCE AGENCIES. I THINK THE PLAN WAS TOTAL DENIABILITY ON ALL SIDES AND IT WAS STRUCTURED TO PREVENT INTER-AGENCY RIVALRY. THE SYNDICATE HAD PRIME-MINISTERIAL SIGN OFF, BUT AFTER THAT THERE IS NO PAPER TRAIL AND THERE HAS BEEN NO NEWS OF ANY PROGRESS. INSIDERS THINK THE SYNDICATE WAS CLOSED DOWN IN JANUARY AFTER RUMOURS OF UNAUTHORISED SURVEILLANCE, BUT GIVEN THAT BULK COLLECTION IN THE UK IS AUTHORISED, IT IS HARD TO IMAGINE WHAT THEY WERE UP TO. 
I KNOW THAT SEVERAL OF THE PEOPLE WHO LAUNCHED PDS LEFT THE CIVIL SERVICE IN FEBRUARY AND TWO NOW HAVE BOARD POSITIONS AT CITADELLE. TO THE BEST OF MY KNOWLEDGE NONE OF THE SENIORS HAD DIRECT CONTACT WITH JAMELIA OR MARTIN, BUT I SUPPOSE IT IS POSSIBLE THAT CITADELLE WAS JUST THE VEHICLE FOR PDS TO KEEP AN EYE ON THE TWO OF THEM. I STILL DON’T KNOW WHY THEY WERE REGARDED AS SPECIAL THOUGH. MAYBE TRINITY HAS SOMETHING FOR US. 
SHE SENT THE FOLLOWING MESSAGE HIDDEN IN AN IMAGE FILE IN INSTAGRAM – A SORT OF “WISH YOU WERE HERE” THING SO I AM GUESSING THAT SHE FEELS THE NEED TO BE FAIRLY DISCRETE. SHE HAS ALSO INCREASED THE SECURITY LEVEL OF HER COMMS, BUT UNFORTUNATELY DUE TO A MIX UP WITH HOUSEKEEPING WE WEREN’T ABLE TO SET UP A SECURE CHANNEL FOR KEY EXCHANGE BEFORE TRINITY LEFT TO JOIN THE DYNAMIX TEAM. FORTUNATELY SHE IS GOOD AT IMPROVISING AND SHE HAS TAKEN A LEAD FROM MARTIN AND USED A COLUMN TRANSPOSITION CIPHER. THAT ALSO EXPLAINS THE STEGANOGRAPHY: TRINITY KNOWS THAT THE OPPOSITION WILL FIND IT REASONABLY STRAIGHTFORWARD TO CRACK IF THEY SPOT IT. A WORD OF WARNING; TRINITY’S CIPHER IS TOUGHER TO CRACK THAN MARTIN’S, AND I HAD TO HUNT A LITTLE BIT FOR THE CRIB, BUT MAYBE YOU WILL FIND IT MORE EASILY KNOWING ALL THIS. AT LEAST SHE DIDN’T RESORT TO MARTIN’S REVERSING TRICK, SO MAYBE WE SHOULD CONSIDER OURSELVES LUCKY. I DON’T WANT TO PUSH OUR LUCK TOO FAR, AND I DON’T WANT TO EXPOSE TRINITY TO MORE RISK THAN NECESSARY. WHEN YOU REPLY I SUGGEST WE FOLLOW TRINITY’S ADVICE AND USE A VIGENERE CIPHER. A KEYWORD OF LENGTH THREE SHOULD BE ADEQUATE.
BEST, 
CHARLIE.
