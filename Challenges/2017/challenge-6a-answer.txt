MARYAM, I FOUND JODIE AT OLYMPIA AND SHE HAS CHAPTER SIX ALREADY. SHE HAD BEEN LEADING THE MIDAS OPERATIVES ON A WILD GOOSE CHASE AROUND SELCUK MAKING A LOT OF NOISE ABOUT LOOKING FOR THE MISSING CHAPTER AT THE TEMPLE OF ARTEMIS. THAT GAVE ME TIME TO RETRIEVE IT FROM JODIE'S FRIEND AT THE BRITISH MUSEUM, WHICH HAS A COLLECTION OF ARTEFACTS FROM THE TEMPLE. JODIE SAYS SHE KNEW WE WOULD FIGURE OUT WHERE TO GO NEXT. THE CLUE WAS IN THE LOCATIONS. THE FIRST ONE WAS AT THE GREAT PYRAMID, THE SECOND AT THE FORT OF QAITBAY WHICH WAS BUILT FROM THE RUINS OF THE LIGHTHOUSE AT ALEXANDRIA AND THE THIRD ON RHODES, AMONG THE RUINS OF THE COLOSSUS. THE KNIGHT'S CASTLE AT BODRUM WAS BUILT FROM THE REMAINS OF THE MAUSOLEUM AT HALICARNASSUS, HENCE THE “GRAVE” TASK OF GUARDING THE BOOK. SO ALL FIVE CHAPTERS WERE FOUND AT THE SITE OF ONE OF THE SEVEN WONDERS OF THE ANCIENT WORLD. THE ONLY REMAINING LOCATIONS ARE THE STATUE OF ZEUS AT OLYMPIA AND THE HANGING GARDENS OF BABYLON, AND NO-ONE HAS ANY IDEA WHERE THE GARDENS MIGHT HAVE BEEN, SO THE ONLY PLACE WE COULD GO NEXT IS OLYMPIA. THE CLUE AT THE END OF CHAPTER FIVE POINTS STRAIGHT THERE, SINCE LIGHTING, BULL AND OAK ARE ALL SYMBOLS OF ZEUS.
WE SHOULD BE SAFE HERE BECAUSE JODIE'S NETWORK HAS SENT HER ATTACKERS ON TO LONDON BY LAYING A LONG TRAIL OF FORGED DOCUMENTS REVEALING THE LOCATION OF CHAPTER FIVE. THAT BOUGHT US ENOUGH TIME TO LOCATE AND DECIPHER CHAPTER SIX. WE HAD BEEN THINKING ABOUT THE EVOLUTION OF THE IMPERIAL CIPHERS. TACITUS USED BOTH THE VIGENERE AND BEAUFORT CIPHERS WHICH ARE POLYALPHABETIC VERSIONS OF THE CAESAR SHIFT, AND AT FIRST WE ASSUMED THAT CHAPTER SIX WOULD BE ENCRYPTED THE SAME WAY. WE WERE ALMOST RIGHT.
MEANWHILE JODIE'S UNEXPECTED TALENT FOR FORGERY HAS GIVEN ME AN IDEA. I THINK WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO TURN OUR ENEMIES ON ONE ANOTHER BY EXPLOITING HER GIFT, BUT I KNOW HER CURRENT FOCUS IS FIGURING OUT WHERE ON EARTH THE SEVENTH WONDER MIGHT BE.
