THE SHAME OF MY ESTEEMED AND NOBLE KINSMEN, GNAEUS JULIUS AGRICOLA, IS A STORY TOO OFTEN TOLD IN THE TAVERNS OF ROME FOR THE ENTERTAINMENT OF FOOLS AND COWARDS WHO NEVER ONCE LEFT THE SAFETY OF THAT GREAT CITY. THE LOSS OF THE IXTH LEGION’S STANDARD IN BATTLE HAUNTED HIM THROUGHOUT HIS LIFE AND ONLY HIS UNTIMELY DEATH BROUGHT HIM RELIEF. AND YET THE FULL DEPTH OF HIS SUFFERING IS KNOWN ONLY TO A FEW, AND EVEN I WAS NOT TAKEN INTO HIS CONFIDENCE UNTIL AFTER HIS DEATH. THE TRUTH OF THE PERIL IN WHICH HE PLACED THE ENTIRE ROMAN ARMY WAS FINALLY REVEALED TO ME IN THE PAPERS HE LEFT TO ME IN HIS WILL. AMONG THEM I FOUND THIS DESPATCH FROM SEXTUS VARUS, LEGATUS OF THE IXTH LEGION, TO GAIUS SUETONIUS PAULLINUS, PROCONSUL AND GOVERNOR OF BRITANNIA, DESCRIBING THE DEFEAT OF THE NINTH AT CAMULODONUM;
“AT THE WRITING OF THIS MESSAGE THE ICENI HAVE SUCCESSFULLY SACKED THE CITY, INCLUDING THE TEMPLE OF CLAUDIUS WHERE THE PROCURATOR’S GUARD TOOK THEIR HEROIC FINAL STAND. WE WERE ALMOST ENCIRCLED BY THE ENEMY FORCE, WHO SEEMED POSSESSED OF THE POWER TO KNOW OUR THOUGHTS. WHERE WE WERE STRONG THEY POSTED ONLY HOLDING FORCES, WHERE WE WERE WEAK THEY ATTACKED IN STRENGTH, AND WHEN REINFORCEMENTS ATTEMPTED TO JOIN US THEY WERE ATTACKED ON ROUTE. WE SURVIVORS OWE OUR LIVES AND OUR THANKS TO GNAEUS JULIUS AGRICOLA, WHO IN A TIME OF GREAT EMERGENCY RECOGNISED THE STRATEGY OF THE INSURGENT FORCES ON OUR LEFT FLANK AND COMMANDED OUR RETREAT WITH MOMENTS TO SPARE. DUE TO THIS ACTION THE MAJORITY OF OUR CAVALRY WERE SAVED ALONG WITH THE RESERVE FORCES. ALL OTHER FRONTLINE TROOPS HAVE BEEN SLAUGHTERED, AND IT IS WITH GREAT SADNESS AND DEEPEST ANGER I HAVE TO REPORT THAT THE IXTH LEGION LOST ITS AQUILA TO THE ENEMY.
I FEAR THAT IF WE ARE TO SAVE LONDINIUM AND VERULANIUM FROM A SIMILAR FATE WE MUST FIND THE STRENGTH TO CRUSH THIS REBELLION. IF WE FAIL THEN ALL OF BRITANNIA IS LOST.”
THIS MUCH OF AGRICOLA'S STORY IS WIDELY KNOWN BUT THE FULL TRUTH MUST REMAIN HIDDEN FOR NOW, AND AS REMARKED BY MY TRUSTED SLAVE AND CONFIDANT TIRO, WHAT BETTER PLACE TO HIDE A BOOK THAN AMONG BOOKS?
